I was a bit nervous when the exam started. I took the exam under supervision through Pearson VUE. The supervision was interestingly arranged â€“ there was no communication with the proctor at all. They took photos of both me and the exam environment, and after that, the camera was turned on. The proctor was able to monitor everything I did through it.

ðŸ§  **Case Study Section â€“ A Pleasant Surprise**
The exam began with case study tasks. I was surprised because they felt easier than the ones in the practice exams. I had read warnings beforehand saying these could take a lot of time, but I was able to get through them fairly quickly.

The information was clearly organized on separate pages, including technical goals and the current situation. In the practice exams, everything was scattered across multiple A4 sheets, which made them harder. Of course, I donâ€™t know if my answers were correct since the exam never shows that at any point.

ðŸ¤¯ **Challenging Questions and Strategy**
There were about 10 more difficult questions in the exam. One in particular about a backend load balancer went really deep into technical details. You can flag questions in the exam to return to them later â€“ I used this feature for the challenging ones.

Important to note: You canâ€™t go back to the case study section or certain ongoing task types once you've answered them.

ðŸ“š **Using Documentation**
I had about 30 minutes left to tackle the more difficult questions. I used this time to browse Microsoftâ€™s Azure documentation. I was probably able to correct one of my answers with the help of the documentation.

Still, I recommend: Donâ€™t rely solely on documentation. Itâ€™s important to study properly in advance â€“ the documentation is only helpful in specific situations.

âœ… Final Result
In the end, I saw my result:
800 / 1000 points ðŸ’ª
I scored about 80% in every area.

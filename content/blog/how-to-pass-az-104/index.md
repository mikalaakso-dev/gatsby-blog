If you're planning to take the AZ-104 Azure Administrator certification exam from Microsoft, here are a few tips that helped me pass the test.

1. **Watch John Savill’s Azure Masterclass**
First, I recommend watching John Savill’s Azure Masterclass (on YouTube). It thoroughly covers the topics for the AZ-104 exam and also provides broader context. Savill’s way of drawing things out on the whiteboard really helps make abstract concepts much easier to understand.

2. **Practice exams and documentation**
Next, get a practice test package with around 450 questions. Choose one that includes:

Explanations for why each answer is correct or incorrect

Links to Microsoft Learn documentation – which you're also allowed to use during the exam.

This helps you actually learn the material instead of just memorizing answers. I personally used the Udemy course:
AZ-104 Practice Tests: Microsoft Azure Administrator (2025)

3. **Complete the GitHub lab exercises**
At this point, it's a good idea to go through all the official labs on Azure here:
https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/AZ-104-MicrosoftAzureAdministrator/tree/master/Instructions/Labs
If you create a new Azure account, you'll get $200 in credits, so doing these labs won’t cost anything. Working through them gave me confidence that I could actually perform the tasks instead of just watching videos.

After completing the labs, the Microsoft Learn AZ-104 learning path started to make much more sense to me. So I recommend doing it at this stage:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/courses/az-104t00

4. **Keep doing practice exams until you almost know every answer**
Keep taking practice tests until you’re consistently scoring over 90% – but don’t just settle for memorizing the right answers. Make sure you understand why a certain answer is correct. While doing practice tests, it’s also worth watching FreeCodeCamp’s
Azure Administrator Certification (AZ-104) – Full Course to PASS the Exam.
This course covers many topics you'll see on the real exam, but it’s very detailed, so it’s best to watch it at this point in your prep.

With this plan you should pass the exam. Good luck!

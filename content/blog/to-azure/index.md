I became interested in programming in 2017 while running an online store with my wife from Spain. I had free time to learn new things, so I started watching Harvard’s CS50 lectures on YouTube and working through FreeCodeCamp exercises. The beginning was challenging, but I quickly discovered how captivating problem-solving and gaining new insights could be.

**First Practical Job**  
In 2020, my interest expanded from programming to IT infrastructure. I started exploring the basics of AWS, which opened up entirely new perspectives on how modern services and applications are built in the cloud. Motivated by this, I applied for IT jobs and began my career in August 2021 in a Service Desk role.

I really enjoyed the work – I learned a lot about systems, customer service, and troubleshooting. In 2022, I moved into a more responsible role as a Process Controller.

**Cybersecurity and Frontend Projects**  
At the end of 2022, I became interested in cybersecurity and started doing exercises on the TryHackMe platform. In summer 2023, I completed the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate, which provided a solid overview of cybersecurity fundamentals.

That same year, I also built a frontend-based project using React.

**Towards Cloud Services and the World of Azure**  
In 2024, I joined a project that involved building an integration application on Azure. Among other tools, we used:

- Azure Functions  
- Storage Account  
- REST APIs and authentication  

This experience opened my eyes to Azure's architecture and how a wide variety of services can be integrated in versatile ways.

**Certified Expertise**  
In spring 2025, I completed Microsoft’s official AZ-104: Microsoft Azure Administrator certification. It solidified my practical knowledge, especially in the following areas:

- Entra ID  
- Storage  
- Virtual Machines  
- Networking  
- Monitoring  

I’ve learned a lot along the way – self-study hasn’t always been easy, but it’s been rewarding. My journey continues, and I want to keep deepening my expertise in cloud services, DevOps practices, and cybersecurity.

I love working with **Azure infrastructure and DevOps**, but it can be a bit tricky to really practice those skills in a meaningful way.

That’s why I’ve been spending more time with **cybersecurity**, especially **blue team topics**—because there are some amazing resources out there for learning by doing.

Lately, I’ve been using [CyberDefenders.org](https://cyberdefenders.org), which offers a ton of high-quality, realistic challenges in areas like:

- 🕵️‍♀️ Network forensics  
- 📊 Log analysis  
- 🧠 Malware Analysis  

These tasks are fun, challenging, and really push you to **think like a defender**.

To keep things safe and separate from my daily work environment, I set up an **Ubuntu virtual machine** on my computer. It’s the perfect isolated lab where I can explore, learn, and even break things—without risk to my main system.

If you're looking to grow your cybersecurity skills—especially on the **blue team** side—this is a great way to start.
